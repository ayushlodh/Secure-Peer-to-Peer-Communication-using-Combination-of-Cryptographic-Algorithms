Communication has become an important part in our day-to-day life. It can be either for business  purposes, personal chatting or even covert communication between military personnel. Today there  are many chat applications available on the app stores which can be downloaded on personal devices  and used to communicate. Many of them offer end- to end encryption like WhatsApp. But there may  be situations when you are using an unsecure non-personal device. You cannot download an app or  any software on this device, or signup and use the device for communication.
